# SDG 3.1 – Maternal Mortality Analysis using IBM Cloud

## 📌 Project Overview
Maternal mortality remains a major global health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income countries.  
This project focuses on analyzing maternal health indicators to track progress toward **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.1**, which aims to reduce the maternal mortality ratio to less than **70 per 100,000 live births by 2030**.

The project uses the **AI Kosh SDG National Indicator Framework dataset** and implements data analysis and machine learning models using **IBM Cloud Lite services**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze country-wise maternal health indicators.
- Identify factors influencing maternal mortality.
- Predict maternal mortality risk using machine learning.
- Assess whether countries are on track to achieve SDG 3.1.

## 🧠 System Approach
- Data is uploaded and preprocessed in IBM watsonx.ai Studio.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to identify patterns.
- Machine learning models are automatically generated using IBM AutoAI.
- The best-performing model is selected and deployed on IBM Cloud for prediction.

---

## 🤖 Algorithm & Deployment
- AutoAI automatically selects and optimizes suitable machine learning algorithms.
- Models such as Extra Trees and Random Forest are evaluated.
- The final model is deployed as an online service in IBM watsonx.ai Studio.
- Predictions can be generated using CSV or manual input.

---

## 📊 Results
- The deployed model predicts maternal mortality levels or SDG 3.1 risk status.
- Countries are classified as low, medium, or high risk.
- Results help identify regions requiring urgent maternal health interventions.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how cloud-based data analysis and machine learning can support monitoring of maternal health outcomes.  
By using IBM Cloud Lite and AutoAI, the system reduces manual effort, improves efficiency, and supports data-driven decisions toward achieving SDG 3.1.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration of real-time and updated maternal health data.
- Inclusion of more countries and regional comparisons.
- Improved prediction accuracy using advanced models.
- Development of interactive dashboards for policymakers.
